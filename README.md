# A Ray Tracer in Go, turning code and pixels into lights and dreams

## What is Ray Tracer to Begin  With

It's a technique that creates realistic 3D images by simulating the physical behavior of light,
tracing individual light as they interact with objects, bounce off surfaces, and change direction
through refraction and reflection.

In computer graphics it's used to produce highly detailed images with accurate shadows, reflections, and 
lighting, enhancing realism into games, films and virtual things!

## The Go Part

The Original book uses C++ as the language of choice to make this Ray Tracer. I don't know any C++ so I'm
making it in Go, as it's my primary working language at the moment, and I've been also really enjoying to work with.
The name of the book says "In One Weekend". Let's see how long it takes me to do it.
